Google Directions API
=====================

Google Directions API is a easy-to-use library written in Java. Google Directions API
parses the JSON received from the Google servers and builds a tree of objects which
can be used to easily draw the routes over a Google Map layout.

Include it into your workspace, create a 'Router' object and then call 'queryRoute()'.
